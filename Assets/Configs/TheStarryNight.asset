  title: The Starry Night
  author: Vincent van Gogh
  description: "The Starry Night is an oil on canvas painting by Dutch Post-Impressionist
    painter Vincent van Gogh. Painted in June 1889, it depicts the view from the
    east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-R\xE9my-de-Provence, just before
    sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village. It has been in the permanent
    collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City since 1941, acquired
    through the Lillie P. Bliss Bequest. Widely regarded as Van Gogh's magnum opus,
    The Starry Night is one of the most recognized paintings in Western art."
