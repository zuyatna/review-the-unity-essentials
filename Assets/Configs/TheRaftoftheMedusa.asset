  title: The Raft of the Medusa
  author: "Th\xE9odore G\xE9ricault"
  description: "The Raft of the Medusa is an oil painting of 1818\u201319 by the
    French Romantic painter and lithographer Th\xE9odore G\xE9ricault (1791\u20131824).
    Completed when the artist was 27, the work has become an icon of French Romanticism.
    At 491 by 716 cm, it is an over-life-size painting that depicts a moment from
    the aftermath of the wreck of the French naval frigate M\xE9duse, which ran aground
    off the coast of today's Mauritania on 2 July 1816."
