  title: The Wedding at Cana
  author: Paolo Veronese
  description: "The Wedding Feast at Cana (1563), by Paolo Veronese (1528\u20131588),
    is a representational painting that depicts the biblical story of the Marriage
    at Cana, at which Jesus converts water to wine. Executed in the Mannerist style
    of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77m \xD7 9.94m) oil painting comprehends
    the stylistic ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by the artists Leonardo,
    Raphael, and Michelangelo."
